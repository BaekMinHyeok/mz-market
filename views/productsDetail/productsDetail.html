              The patented eighteen-inch hardwood Arrowhead deck --- finely
              mortised in, makes this the strongest and most rigid canoe ever
              built. You cannot buy a canoe that will afford greater
              satisfaction. The St. Louis Meramec Canoe Company was founded by
              Alfred Wickett in 1922. Wickett had previously worked for the Old
              Town Canoe Co from 1900 to 1914. Manufacturing of the classic
              wooden canoes in Valley Park, Missouri ceased in 1978. Regular
              fit, mid-weight t-shirt Natural color, 100% premium combed organic

                  Very nice feeling sweater. I like it better than a regular
                  hoody because it is tailored to be a slimmer fit. Perfect for
                  going out when you want to stay comfy. The head opening is a
                  little tight which makes it a little.
